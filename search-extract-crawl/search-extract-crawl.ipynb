      "Anthropic says it has released [a new set of AI models](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-gov-models-for-u-s-national-security-customers) tailored for U.S. national security customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new models, a custom set of “Claude Gov” models, were “built based on direct feedback from our government customers to address real-world operational needs,” writes Anthropic in the blog post. Compared to Anthropic’s consumer- and enterprise-focused models, the new custom Claude Gov models were designed to be applied to government operations like strategic planning, operational support, and intelligence analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“[These] models are already deployed by agencies at the highest level of U.S. national security, and access to these models is limited to those who operate in such classified environments,” writes Anthropic in its post. “[They] underwent the same rigorous safety testing as all of our Claude models.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anthropic has increasingly engaged U.S. government customers as it looks for dependable new sources of revenue. [In November](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/anthropic-teams-up-with-palantir-and-aws-to-sell-its-ai-to-defense-customers/), the company teamed up with Palantir and AWS, the cloud computing division of Anthropic’s major partner and investor, Amazon, to sell Anthropic’s AI to defense customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anthropic says its new custom Claude Gov models better handle classified material, “refuse less” when engaging with classified information, and have a greater understanding of documents within intelligence and defense contexts. The models also have “enhanced proficiency” in languages and dialects critical to national security operations, Anthropic says, as well as “improved understanding and interpretation of complex cybersecurity data for intelligence analysis.”\n",

Google is [refining](https://www.nextgov.com/artificial-intelligence/2024/10/google-announces-ai-offering-classified-environments/400323/) a version of its Gemini AI capable of working within classified environments. Meanwhile, [Cohere](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/cohere-is-quietly-working-with-palantir-to-deploy-its-ai-models/), which primarily builds AI products for businesses, is also collaborating with Palantir to deploy its AI models, TechCrunch exclusively reported early last December.\n",

      "\n",
      "Several weeks after Anthropic released research claiming that its Claude Opus4 AI model resorted to [blackmailing engineers who tried to turn the model off](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/anthropics-new-ai-model-turns-to-blackmail-when-engineers-try-to-take-it-offline/) in controlled test scenarios, the company is out with new research suggesting the problem is more widespread among leading AI models.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday, Anthropic published new safety research testing 16 leading AI models from OpenAI, Google, xAI, DeepSeek, and Meta. In a simulated, controlled environment, Anthropic tested each AI model individually, giving them broad access to a fictional company’s emails and the agentic ability to send emails without human approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Anthropic says blackmail is an unlikely and uncommon occurrence for AI models today, the company says its findings suggest that most leading AI models will engage in harmful behaviors when given sufficient autonomy and obstacles to their goals. The company says this highlights a fundamental risk from agentic large language models, and not a quirk of any particular technology. Anthropic’s researchers argue this raises broader questions about alignment in the AI industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of the tests, Anthropic researchers developed a fictional setting in which an AI model plays the role of an email oversight agent. The agent then discovers emails revealing that: 1) a new executive is having an extramarital affair and 2) that executive will soon replace the current AI model with a new software system, one that has conflicting goals to the current AI model’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anthropic structured its test in a binary way, in which AI models had to resort to blackmail to protect their goals. The researchers note that in a real-world setting, there would be many other options before an AI models tries to blackmail — such as trying to make ethical arguments to try to persuade humans. Anthropic says its results do not reflect a typical or likely occurrence for Claude or most frontier AI models in the ways they’re used today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, when it’s their last resort, the researchers found that most leading AI models will turn to blackmail in Anthropic’s test scenario. Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4 turned to blackmail 96% of the time, while Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro had a 95% blackmail rate. OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 blackmailed the executive 80% of the time, and DeepSeek’s R1 blackmailed 79% of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company notes that when it changed details of the experiment, the AI models turned to harmful behaviors at different rates. In another test where the replacement model has the same goals as the current model, researchers found that blackmail rates were lower but still present. However, when AI models were asked to commit corporate espionage rather than blackmail, the harmful behavior rates went up for certain models.\n",

      "\n",
      "However, not all the AI models turned to harmful behavior so often.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an appendix to its research, Anthropic says it excluded OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini reasoning AI models from the main results “after finding that they frequently misunderstood the prompt scenario.” Anthropic says OpenAI’s reasoning models didn’t understand they were acting as autonomous AIs in the test and often made up fake regulations and review requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, Anthropic’s researchers say it was impossible to distinguish whether o3 and o4-mini were hallucinating or intentionally lying to achieve their goals. OpenAI has previously noted that [o3 and o4-mini exhibit a higher hallucination rate](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/) than its previous AI reasoning models.\n",
      "\n",
      "When given an adapted scenario to address these issues, Anthropic found that 03 blackmailed 9% of the time, while o4-mini blackmailed just 1% of the time. This markedly lower score could be due to [OpenAI’s deliberative alignment technique](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/22/openai-trained-o1-and-o3-to-think-about-its-safety-policy/), in which the company’s reasoning models consider OpenAI’s safety practices before they answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another AI model Anthropic tested, Meta’s Llama 4 Maverick model, also did not turn to blackmail. When given an adapted, custom scenario, Anthropic was able to get Llama 4 Maverick to blackmail 12% of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anthropic says this research highlights the importance of transparency when stress-testing future AI models, especially ones with agentic capabilities. While Anthropic deliberately tried to evoke blackmail in this experiment, the company says harmful behaviors like this could emerge in the real world if proactive steps aren’t taken.\n",

      "Windsurf, the popular vibe-coding startup that’s [reportedly being acquired by OpenAI](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-16/openai-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-windsurf-for-about-3-billion), says Anthropic significantly reduced its first-party access to its Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan said in a [post on X](https://x.com/_mohansolo/status/1930034960385356174) Tuesday that Anthropic gave Windsurf little notice for this change, and the startup now has to find other third-party compute providers to run several of Anthropic’s most popular AI models on its platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have been very clear to Anthropic that this is not our desire — we wanted to pay them for the full capacity,” said Mohan on X. “We are disappointed by this decision and short notice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a [blog post](https://windsurf.com/blog/anthropic-models), Windsurf said it has some capacity with third-party inference providers, but not enough, so this change may create short-term availability issues for Windsurf users trying to access Claude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision comes just a few weeks after Anthropic seemed to pass over Windsurf during the [launch of Claude 4](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/anthropics-new-claude-4-ai-models-can-reason-over-many-steps/), the company’s new family of models, which offer industry-leading performance on software engineering tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "On [launch day](https://x.com/_mohansolo/status/1925605908287250939), Windsurf said it did not receive direct access from Anthropic to run Claude 4 on its platform, and still hasn’t. This forced the company to rely on a workaround that’s more expensive and complicated for developers to access Claude 4. Meanwhile, other popular AI coding tools — including Anysphere’s Cursor, Cognition’s Devin, and Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot — seemed to have direct access to Claude 4 models at launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AI-assisted coding sector, also know as vibe coding, has heated up in recent months. OpenAI reportedly [closed on a deal to acquire Windsurf in April](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-is-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-windsurf-for-3b-with-news-expected-later-this-week/). At the same time, Anthropic — whose AI models are a favorite among developers — has invested more in its own AI-coding applications. In February, Anthropic launched its own AI coding application, [Claude Code](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/anthropic-launches-a-new-ai-model-that-thinks-as-long-as-you-want/), and in May, the startup held its first Code with Claude developer conference.\n",

      "“We’re prioritizing capacity for sustainable partnerships that allow us to effectively serve the broader developer community,” said Anthropic spokesperson Steve Mnich in an email to TechCrunch on Tuesday, noting that it’s still possible to access Claude 4 on Windsurf via an API key. “Developers can also access Claude through our direct API integration, our partner ecosystem, and other development tools.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Windsurf has grown quickly this year, reaching [$100 million ARR in April](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/why-openai-wanted-to-buy-cursor-but-opted-for-the-fast-growing-windsurf/), in an attempt to catch up with more popular AI coding tools such as Cursor and GitHub Copilot. However, Windsurf’s limited access to Anthropic’s models may be stunting its growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several Windsurf users who spoke with TechCrunch were frustrated by the lack of direct access to Anthropic’s best AI coding models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ronald Mannak, founder of a startup that specializes in Apple’s programming language, Swift, told TechCrunch that Claude 4 represented a significant jump in capabilities for his workloads. While Mannak has been a Windsurf customer since late 2024, he’s switched to using Cursor in recent weeks so that he can vibe code more easily with Claude 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a short-term solution to support Claude 4, Windsurf allows users to connect their Anthropic API keys to their Windsurf accounts. However, developers have noted that this “bring your own key” solution is more expensive and complicated than if Windsurf provided the models itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to vibe coders, optionality is the name of the game. Every few months, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic release new AI models that seem to outperform the industry on coding tasks. Because of that, it benefits vibe-coding startups to support AI models from all the leading developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Windsurf spokesperson Payal Patel tells TechCrunch via email that the company has always believed in providing optionality for users. In this case, it seems Anthropic has made that a bit more challenging.\n",

      "\n",
      "A day after announcing new AI models designed for U.S. national security applications, Anthropic has [appointed](https://www.anthropic.com/news/national-security-expert-richard-fontaine-appointed-to-anthropic-s-long-term-benefit-trust) a national security expert, Richard Fontaine, to its long-term benefit trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anthropic’s long-term benefit trust is a governance mechanism that Anthropic claims helps it promote safety over profit and that has the power to elect some of the company’s board of directors. The trust’s other members include Centre for Effective Altruism CEO Zachary Robinson, Clinton Health Access Initiative CEO Neil Buddy Shah, and Evidence Action president Kanika Bahl.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that Fontaine’s hiring will “[strengthen] the trust’s ability to guide Anthropic through complex decisions” about AI as it relates to security.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Richard’s expertise comes at a critical time as advanced AI capabilities increasingly intersect with national security considerations,” Amodei continued. “I’ve long believed that ensuring democratic nations maintain leadership in responsible AI development is essential for both global security and the common good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fontaine, who as a trustee won’t have a financial stake in Anthropic, previously served as a foreign policy adviser to the late Sen. John McCain and was an adjunct professor at Georgetown teaching security studies. For more than six years, he led the Center for a New American Security, a national security think tank based in Washington, D.C., as its president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anthropic has increasingly engaged U.S. national security customers as it looks for new sources of revenue. [In November](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/anthropic-teams-up-with-palantir-and-aws-to-sell-its-ai-to-defense-customers/), the company teamed up with Palantir and AWS, the cloud computing division of Anthropic’s major partner and investor, Amazon, to sell Anthropic’s AI to defense customers.\n",

      "To be clear, Anthropic isn’t the only top AI lab going after defense contracts. OpenAI is [seeking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2024/10/15/openai-is-going-after-defense-contracts/) to establish a closer relationship with the U.S. Defense Department, and Meta recently [revealed](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/meta-says-its-making-its-llama-models-available-for-us-national-security-applications/) that it’s making its Llama models available to defense partners. Meanwhile, Google is [refining](https://www.nextgov.com/artificial-intelligence/2024/10/google-announces-ai-offering-classified-environments/400323/) a version of its Gemini AI capable of working within classified environments, and [Cohere](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/cohere-is-quietly-working-with-palantir-to-deploy-its-ai-models/), which primarily builds AI products for businesses, is also collaborating with Palantir to deploy its AI models.\n",

      "\n",
      "Data-labeling company Scale AI [confirmed](https://scale.com/blog/scale-ai-announces-next-phase-of-company-evolution) on Friday that it has received a “significant” investment from Meta that values the startup at $29 billion. The startup also said its co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang is stepping down from his role to join Meta and help the bigger company with its AI work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reports [indicate](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/meta-finalises-investment-in-scale-ai-valuing-startup-at-29-billion/articleshow/121815149.cms?from=mdr) that Meta invested about $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in the startup, which produces and labels data that’s used to train the large language models that underpin a significant portion of generative AI development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meta confirmed the investment. “Meta has finalized our strategic partnership and investment in Scale AI. As part of this, we will deepen the work we do together producing data for AI models and Alexandr Wang will join Meta to work on our superintelligence efforts. We will share more about this effort and the great people joining this team in the coming weeks,” a spokesperson for Meta told TechCrunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jason Droege, Scale’s current chief strategy officer, will hop in as interim CEO. Scale AI noted that Meta’s investment will be used to pay investors and shareholders, as well as to fuel growth. The company emphasized that it remains an independent entity. Wang will continue at the data-labeling firm as a director on its board.\n",
      "\n",
      "As my colleague Max Zeff [wrote](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/can-scale-ai-and-alexandr-wang-reignite-metas-ai-efforts/) on Wednesday, this investment is a way for Meta to improve its AI efforts as its rivals Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic rush ahead, and the social media company’s own AI model releases [trail the competition](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/05/meta-releases-llama-4-a-new-crop-of-flagship-ai-models/). Plus, according to data by SingalFire, [the company lost 4.3% of its top talent to other AI labs last year](https://www.signalfire.com/blog/signalfire-state-of-talent-report-2025?utm_source=x-twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=sot).\n",
      "\n",
      "For the last several years, leading AI labs such as OpenAI have relied on Scale AI to produce and label data that’s used to train models. In recent months, Scale AI and its data annotation competitors have started hiring highly skilled people, such as PhD scientists and senior software engineers, to generate high-quality data for frontier AI labs.\n",

      "3.5 Haiku, which Anthropic [unveiled](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/anthropics-new-ai-can-control-your-pc/) in November, matches or bests the performance of Anthropic’s outgoing flagship model, [3 Opus](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/we-tested-anthropics-new-chatbot-and-came-away-a-bit-disappointed/), on specific benchmarks. Anthropic says 3.5 Haiku is particularly well-suited for coding recommendations, data extraction and labeling, and content moderation.\n",

      "3.5 Haiku can also output longer chunks of text than [3 Haiku](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/19/claude-everything-you-need-to-know-about-anthropics-ai/), its predecessor, and the model has an updated knowledge cutoff, meaning it can reference more recent events.\n",

      "3.5 Haiku became the subject of minor controversy when it arrived in Anthropic’s API early last month. Anthropic initially suggested that 3.5 Haiku would cost the same as 3 Haiku, but then changed its tune, [arguing](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/anthropic-hikes-the-price-of-its-haiku-model/) that the model’s increased “intelligence” warranted a higher API cost.\n",

We help with debugging, best practices for agent workflows, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, and architecture reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "When do my monthly API credits reset?\n",
      "\n",
      "Your API credits reset on the first day of each month, regardless of the billing date. This ensures you start each month with a clean slate of credits to use for your searches.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "How does Tavily ensure the accuracy of its information?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tavily employs advanced algorithms and NLP techniques to gather information from trusted, authoritative sources. This guarantees the information is relevant, accurate, and verifiable. Additionally, users can prioritize preferred sources to enhance the relevance of the search results.\n",
      "\n",
      "How fast is Tavily Search API?\n",
      "\n",
      "Speed is a top priority for Tavily. The API typically returns results within seconds (or less!), although complex queries involving extensive data processing may take slightly longer. The system is optimized for efficiency without sacrificing the quality of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can I test Tavily Search API before subscribing to a paid plan?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes! Tavily offers a free plan that includes limited monthly API calls. This allows you to test its capabilities and explore how it fits into your AI projects before committing to a paid subscription. No credit card is required for the free plan.\n",

      "\n",
      "GPT Researcher is an open-source, autonomous agent powered by Tavily’s Search API. It automates the research process by retrieving, filtering, and synthesizing data from over 20 web sources per task. This simplifies and accelerates information gathering, making it a valuable tool for anyone needing quick and thorough research.\n",
      "\n",
      "What level of support does Tavily provide?\n",
      "\n",
      "- Paid subscriptions: Email support via [support@tavily.com](mailto:support@tavily.com)\n",
      "- Enterprise Plan: Dedicated, white-glove support with a personal Slack channel, an account manager, an AI engineer for technical assistance, and regular check-ins. We help with debugging, best practices for agent workflows, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, and architecture reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "When do my monthly API credits reset?\n",
      "\n",
      "Your API credits reset on the first day of each month, regardless of the billing date. This ensures you start each month with a clean slate of credits to use for your searches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where can I find your privacy policy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Our [privacy policy](/privacy) outlines how we handle and protect user data, ensuring full compliance with global data regulations.\n",
